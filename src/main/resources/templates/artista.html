    <h1>Lucio Fontana</h1>

    <b>Argentina <span>19/02/1899</span> - <span>7/09/1968</span></b>

    <p>Born in Rosario, province of Santa Fe, Argentina to Italian immigrant parents, he was the son of the sculptor
        Luigi Fontana (1865 — 1946).[2][3] Fontana spent the first years of his life in Argentina and then was sent to
        Italy in 1905, where he stayed until 1922, working as a sculptor with his father, and then on his own. Already
        in 1926, he participated in the first exhibition of Nexus, a group of young Argentine artists working in Rosario
        de Santa Fé.[4]
